# Bancroft-Application

This mobile app will provide a central location for students to have access to all of the school tools (schedule, homework planner, college planner, etc.) that they use on a daily basis. It will also eventually utilize notifications to give the students updates on newly assigned homework or what class they should head to next. It will be optimized for students at Bancroft school in Massachusetts.
